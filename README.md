![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_l4.svg?color=brightgreen)

## Overview

The STM32L4 CMSIS Device MCU Component for RT-Thread is a software interface module specifically designed for the STM32L4 series of microcontrollers, facilitating their integration with RT-Thread, a popular real-time operating system. This component leverages the Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard (CMSIS) to standardize MCU functionality and simplify software reuse across different systems. 

## Description

This **stm32l4_cmsis_driver** MCU component repo is one element of the STM32L4 MCU embedded software package, providing the CMSIS driver part for RT-Thread.
